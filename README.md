# TJ Schedule Comparator

The TJ Schedule Comparator is a PHP web application that lets students compare schedules with their classmates before classes begin.

The canonical version lives at https://jeffsweb.net/scheduler/.

## Credits
The Schedule Comparator was originally created circa 2001 by Craig Fratrik, with HTML layout by Moses Lei, and additional features contributed by Andy Oxfeld. Evan Danaher blatantly copied the original implementation (with permission), which was later copied/hosted by Jeff Grafton after school staff took down the app.

The app was completely rewritten in 2005, and has had occasionally maintenance and feature improvements since.
